# Pedal-Base

## Project Description

A collection of popular musical effects pedals that a user can view, add to, and explore. It will have a homepage with links to view the entire list or search for a specific pedal, a starter page with basic information on effects pedals, a pageto add a pedal, and a page to pull a random pedal from the list and return it. There will also be links to each individual pedal that is accessed from the list.

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths: Familiar with Airtable APIs and accessing data, have a clear plan for how to fulfill all MVP requirements

Weaknesses: Styling, ambitious post-MVP goals, try to do too many things at once

Opportunities: Make a clean looking site with basic functionality and database of pedals and build from there

Threats: Spending too much time adding data to the base, not correctly implementing the search function
